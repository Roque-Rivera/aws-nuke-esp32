# AWS NUKE BUTTON PROJECT

## Description

AWS Nuke Button is a simple shitty project to use an ESP-C3 board, a switch and a button to emulate a RED BUTTON that destroys all resources in the students laboratory account.
It is designed as a funny and totally innecesary overengineered project to delete all "left behind"" resources every week in the students lab account.

## How it started

The project started as a joke, but it turned out to be a fun and useful project. The idea was to create a button that would delete all resources in the students lab account, but it quickly evolved into a more complex project that includes an ESP-C3 board, a switch, a test button and a emergency button as NUKE BUTTON.

## How it works

The project uses an ESP-C3 board to connect to the internet and send a request to our âœ¨FANCY NEW ARCHITECTUREâœ¨. Gone are the days of overpriced Fargate tasks - we've gone full cheapskate mode!

Now our little ESP-C3 board sends a request straight to an API Gateway, which triggers a Lambda function running the aws-nuke container. It's like we fired the middle manager (Fargate) and let the intern (Lambda) do all the work! ðŸ’¸ðŸ’¸ðŸ’¸

When you press the test button, it triggers a dry-run via the API. If the Lambda responds with "all systems ready to obliterate" (or some boring HTTP 200 code), the red emergency button lights up like Christmas morning. Press that bad boy, and KABOOM! ðŸ’¥ All those pesky AWS resources go bye-bye.

To recap (because we know reading is hard):

- The switch is used to turn on and off the ESP-C3 board (duh).
- The test button is like asking "are you sure?" before deleting your ex from your contacts.
- The emergency button is basically a digital nuke that makes AWS resources disappear faster than your money in a Steam sale.

## Why Our New Approach Is Better

Our previous approach was like using a bulldozer to kill a fly - complete overkill (and expensive as hell). The new setup:

1. **Costs less than a cup of coffee** - Lambda is crazy cheap compared to keeping Fargate tasks around
2. **Is faster than your professor's ancient laptop** - Direct API calls mean less waiting around
3. **Has fewer moving parts than a dollar store toy** - Fewer services = fewer things to break

Remember kids, the cloud is just someone else's computer - but with our shiny red button, it's someone else's computer that you can DESTROY WITH IMPUNITY! ðŸ˜±
